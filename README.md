# fglrx-for-Fedora
Patches for the AMD fglrx proprietary video driver **15.302** for installing on **Fedora 23 and up**, kernel versions `4.4.*` and later

**WARNING: After the 4.13 patch, I no longer have the ability to test the patches, since I changed video cards and don't have a machine to run fglrx any more. Check comments under "Patches past 4.13 not tested" issue to see if anybody has tried the patch you want to install. I am happy to continue updating the patches, but if you can test and would like to take over, let me know and I'll share my setup to generate the patches.** 

**IMPORTANT NOTE: There is relatively little activity in the development community on this issue and I may not be aware if any new patches become available. If you know of a patch that goes beyond my latest cumulative patch, please let me know.**

The described process and patches in this repository work through at least Fedora Core 26 and kernel `4.13`.

In addition to patches, this repository also contains a convenience [`do_install` script](do_install). Once you have generated your `fglrx-15.302` directory and copied all the files from this git repository there, you can run the do_install script which will extract the install, patch the files depending on your kernel level and run the install. The problem is that **this must be run as `root`**. I wrote this for my own convenience, but urge you to read and understand the contents - for all you know, through either evil or incompetence, I could be messing up your machine beyond repair. The directions below assume you are doing this by hand.

All the patches are cumulative, meaning that **you need only to apply the latest patch**. Check out the patch selection logic in the [`do_install` script](do_install) if you are unsure which patch to install. By and large, if your kernel is `4.x`, then use patch `4.y`, where `y` is the largest available patch number where `y <= x`.

I tend to travel quite a bit, so I might not be at home respond to email or to update the patches for a month or two. Check out [the community discussion page][installing-the-proprietary-amd-crimson-driver-on-fedora-23-with-linux-kernel-4-4-6-300] (long discussion, scroll down to the bottom) to see if there are any changes after the latest patch here. It's also a good place to ask questions if you run into troubles. New patches are usually found by A.I. (thanks!) and announced there and I just roll them in and publish them here.

Any time you upgrade to a new kernel, it's a good idea to rebuild yout fglrx - it's not always necessary, but it often is. Even if the patches haven't changed, some other component might have and your driver may either stop working or work very slowly.

The rest of this README summarizes the excellent instructions from [the community discussion page][installing-the-proprietary-amd-crimson-driver-on-fedora-23-with-linux-kernel-4-4-6-300], as modified by the discussion for later kernel versions.

## Instructions

1. You must have the card installed for the driver install to work.
1. You must have `kernel-devel` package installed
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install kernel-devel
   ```
1. Copy the `version.h` header file:

    ```bash
    sudo cp /usr/include/linux/version.h /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux/
    ```

1. `fglrx` driver does not work with the Xorg server versions beyond `1.17`, so you must downgrade the server to Fedora 21 in the following two steps:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf downgrade --allowerasing --releasever=21 xorg-x11-server-Xorg xorg-x11-server-common
    ```
   1. Original directions had downgrade to F22 and version `1.17`, but F22 was upgraded to `1.18` and people report downgrading to version `1.16` on F21 works fine.
   1. Add the following line to your `/etc/yum.repos.d/fedora*` files: `exclude=xorg-x11-server-Xorg xorg-x11-server-common`
   1. If the above doesn't work and you still upgrade the packages, just add the following line to your `/etc/dnf/dnf.conf` file: `exclude=xorg-x11-server-Xorg xorg-x11-server-common`
1. **Download the driver** zip from: http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=Linux+x86_64
1. **Unzip** the file to get `fglrx-15.302` directory.
1. Download all the files from this repository's `master` branch to the `fglrx-15.302` directory.
1. Change to the `fglrx-15.302` directory and do:
    ```bash
    amd-driver-installer-15.302-x86.x86_64.run --extract
    ```
   this will make a `fglr-install.<random string>` directory.
1. Change to the install directory
1. Find the right patch, based on your kernel version. The patch minor version should be the latest possible, but not bigger than your current kernel version.
1. If your patch file is `fglrx_kernel_4.X.diff` patch the code by doing:
    ```bash
    patch -p1 < ../fglrx_kernel_4.X.diff
    ```
1. You are now ready to install the driver. The build and install must be done as `root`, reportedly **"sudo" is not enough**. As `root`, change to the install directory.
1. Install the drivers by running:
    ```bash
    ./ati-installer.sh 15.302 --install
    ```
1. When you get the install window, select the second option: "Install driver 15.302 on X.Org 6.9 or later 64-bit"
1. Accept the defaults and let it install
1. Skip reboot when it asks at the end (no problem if you reboot, it just takes little longer)
1. When it comes back, as `root`, run:
    ```bash
    aticonfig --initial
    ```
1. Reboot
1. You "should" be good to go! But, if you're like me, it will take a week before you get it all figured out!
